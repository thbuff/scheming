In this package you have some tools to load and visualize retina sketches dynamically.
Have a look at the script retina_test.py to have an insight!

In the retina_model module you have all the simple classes composing your retina:
    * the neurons
    * the synapses
    * the layers
    * the retina

There is a module retina_import that allows you to define the structure of your retina with a .csv file.
You can load your retina from csv files and generate the corresponding objects with just one function.
Have a look at the data folder for examples of csv files.

In retina_rendering you have a class that deals with graphical representations of your retina.
You can have several graphic sets (I created a new one myself).
With this module you can choose any of those and load the corresponding images with just one function.

In retina_viewer you have the object that handles the final plot: you give it a graphic set, a retina model,
chose some settings, and this object generates the figure for you.
